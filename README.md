# firstWebScraper
This is my first experience of building a simple web scraper using python and BeautifulSoup library

The uploaded files will be sort of a progress report, made on a daily/weekly basis.
Since I am referring two sites for building the scraper, some files might use tools from HTML Parser, while others may use the BeautifulSoup tools.

Any suggestions/improvements are greatly welcomed. Thanks!

Created a new scrape3.py file, using "http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/10/beginner-guide-web-scraping-beautiful-soup-python/" as guidance
No modifications done, simply replicated whatever was there on this blog, to enhance my understanding

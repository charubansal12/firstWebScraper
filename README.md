# firstWebScraper
This is my first experience of building a simple web scraper using python and BeautifulSoup library

The uploaded files will be sort of a progress report, made on a daily/weekly basis.
Since I am referring two sites for building the scraper, some files might use tools from HTML Parser, while others may use the BeautifulSoup tools.

Any suggestions/improvements are greatly welcomed. Thanks!
